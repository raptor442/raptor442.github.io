## Our Mission

Filpac is not just a campaign and PAC management system; it's a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the complexities of campaign management at a reasonable price. Whether you're filing campaign reports, tracking donors, coordinating volunteers, building coalitions, or targeting voters, Filpac is equipped to facilitate these tasks efficiently.

## Our History

The journey of Filpac began in 1988, crafted by Joe Curran, a seasoned veteran with extensive experience in county and legislative campaigns. Since its inception, Filpac has evolved into a versatile tool, supporting campaigns from the local township trustee level to the presidency. Over nearly three decades, our software has been refined and enhanced by the invaluable contributions of Republican campaign managers, consultants, party chairs, treasurers, and fundraisers. This collaborative effort has continuously improved Filpac, making it more effective and user-friendly.

## Our Commitment

At Filpac, we understand the financial constraints and challenges faced by political campaigns of all sizes. That's why we're committed to providing affordable pricing, ensuring that our system is accessible to everyone from small local campaigns to national political efforts. Beyond our software, we take pride in offering unparalleled customer support. Our team is dedicated to maintaining a high standard of service, ensuring that every Filpac user feels supported and valued.

You can count on us to uphold these commitments, providing you with the tools and support you need to run successful campaigns.
