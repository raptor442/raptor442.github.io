Feeling lost in your political campaign? It might be time to get back to basics. Here are ten fundamental truths that hold the key to gaining traction and setting your campaign on the path to victory.

## 1. The Candidate with the Most Votes Wins

It sounds obvious, yet many candidates miss the forest for the trees. Engage in precinct research, understand the electorate, and plan your campaign around getting the actual votes needed to win, not just social media followers.

## 2. Maximize YOUR Vote

Focus on increasing your vote share through direct engagement, rather than trying to diminish your opponent's base. Personal efforts in both strong and weak precincts can yield significant returns.

## 3. Personal Contact is King

The most reliable campaign strategy is personal engagement. Voters are more likely to support you if they feel a personal connection, whether through direct contact or through someone they trust.

## 4. Most Voters are Partisan

Recognize that a large portion of the electorate has already made up their mind based on party lines. Your campaign should focus on swaying the moveable minority and ensuring your base turns out.

## 5. Campaigning Equals Recruiting

A successful campaign is built on a foundation of enthusiastic volunteers and donors. If you're struggling to recruit, addressing this issue should be your first priority.

## 6. Resource Management

Victory often comes down to how well you can manage and allocate limited resources. Effective targeting and prioritization are key.

## 7. No Last-Minute Rescues

Don't rely on external help to save your campaign at the last minute. Focus on building your own solid foundation and plan for self-sufficiency from the start.

## 8. Government Dependence

Be aware of the demographic that receives government assistance and how it may be mobilized against you. Crafting a message that resonates with this group can be challenging but necessary.

## 9. The Importance of Planning

Without a clear plan, your campaign is likely to flounder. Set weekly goals, budget carefully, and adhere to a structured timeline leading up to election day.

## 10. Early Voting

With the rise of absentee and early voting, campaigns must adapt their strategies to engage these voters effectively. Make sure you have the systems in place to track and communicate with these key constituents.
