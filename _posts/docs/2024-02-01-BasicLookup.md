The Filpac system offers intuitive lookup controls to help you navigate through records swiftly and efficiently. Understanding these controls can significantly enhance your ability to manage and access vital information for your campaign.

## Key Features

- **Auto-Complete:** Start typing the first few letters of the person's name or code you're looking for. The system will attempt to auto-complete your entry, making it easier to find what you need without typing the full name or code.

- **Arrow Key Navigation:** Once you've initiated a lookup, you can use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to move through the list of records. This method allows for quick selection without needing to revert to the mouse.

- **F3 Scroll:** For a broader view, press the F3 key to open a scroll window. Here, you can use the Page Up (PgUp) and Page Down (PgDn) keys to move through the list a page at a time. This feature is particularly useful when you're dealing with long lists and need to find a record quickly.
